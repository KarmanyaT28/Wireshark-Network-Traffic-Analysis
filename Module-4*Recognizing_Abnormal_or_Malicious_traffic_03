Examining Macof Attacks
Holds the pairing of MAC Addresses and the switchports
The table can contain thousands of these pairings

Macof attack will disrupt traffic
The attack must continue to bombard the switches with those bogus entries
And when it stops though, the timers will be reset and then the switch will resort back to being like a switch,
  Secure your switches to prevent this type of attack


Macof Attack Mechanism: A Macof attack floods the MAC address table with bogus entries, causing the switch to act like a hub.
Detection: Use Wireshark to capture and analyze packets, identifying numerous SYN packets without acknowledgements.
Prevention: Secure your switches by using port security to prevent such attacks.
