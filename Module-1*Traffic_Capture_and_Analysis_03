Getting ready to capture

Selecting Interfaces: Learn how to choose specific interfaces for capturing network traffic.
Capture Filters: Understand how to apply capture filters to focus on specific types of traffic.
Output Options: Discover how to capture data to permanent or temporary files and use a ring buffer to manage large captures.
Promiscuous Mode: Enable promiscuous mode to capture all traffic, including management, broadcast, and multicast traffic.


Examining a capture

Troubleshooting - It involves assessing trouble spots to determine the root cause of network congestion
Assessing Network Performance - When users perceive the network is slow, there most likely are errors in the transmission of data or network congestion
Performance Metrics
  Latency - time it takes to transmit a packet and we can measure rount-trip time (RTT)
  Throughput - how much data that is sent and received at any given time
  Packet Loss - when data doesn't make it to the final destination
Congestion Control
  Indication of congestion
    Keep-alives
    Duplicates ACKs
    Retransmissions
Server Monitors the connection
  The server keeps track of client acknowledging the data
  If the server does not receive an acknowledgement in timely manner, the server will assume the packet is lost
  This triggers a retransmission of the data

Network Performance Metrics: Understand the importance of latency, throughput, and packet loss in assessing network performance.
Identifying Issues: Learn how to use Wireshark to identify retransmissions and lost segments, which indicate network congestion or errors.
Using Filters: Discover how to apply filters in Wireshark to focus on specific streams and analyze retransmissions effectively.
