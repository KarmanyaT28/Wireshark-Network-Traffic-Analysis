Displaying Time

Time Display Options: Learn about different time display formats in Wireshark, such as seconds since the beginning of capture, seconds since the previously captured packet, and seconds since the previously displayed packet.
Precision Settings: Understand how to set the precision for time display to get the best accuracy.
Identifying Gaps: Discover how to identify gaps in transmission by applying display filters and analyzing the time between packets.
TCP Stream Graphs: Learn how to use TCP stream graphs to visualize transmission delays and gaps in data transmission.

Viewing Details and Expert Info

Capture File Properties: Learn how to access and interpret metadata about a capture, including time, duration, and interface information.
Expert Information Panel: Understand how to use the expert system to identify and investigate potential problems in the capture, categorized by severity and type.
Filtering and Searching: Discover how to filter and search for specific packets or errors within the capture to streamline analysis.

Graphing the TCP Streams

Visualizing TCP Data Streams: Learn how to visualize TCP data streams using TCP stream graphs.
Analyzing Time Gaps: Understand how to analyze time gaps in the data stream to identify delays or congestion.
Window Scaling and Round Trip Time: Discover how to use window scaling and round trip time graphs to assess network performance.
Throughput and Goodput: Learn the difference between throughput and goodput and how to visualize them.
Selective Acknowledgments: Understand the role of selective acknowledgments in TCP and how to visualize them using TCP time sequence graphs.
