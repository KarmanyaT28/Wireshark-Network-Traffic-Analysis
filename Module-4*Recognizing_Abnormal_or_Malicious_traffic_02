Module-4*Recognizing_Abnormal_or_Malicious_traffic_02


Spotting an ARP Storming
Identifying ARP Storms: Use Wireshark to filter for ARP broadcasts and create an IO graph to visualize the traffic.
Potential Causes: ARP storms can result from hardware misconfiguration, attacks, or malware.
Impact and Action: ARP storms degrade network performance and should be investigated to stop the activity.


Multicast
One-to-many or many-to-many
Multicast range is 224.0.0.0 239.255.255.255

Multicast traffic may become bursty

Bursty traffic can disrupt traffic
Bursty traffic can disrupt the flow of traffic
When traffic reaches a device , the device may be full or overwhelmed by the burst and can result in an output drop.


Multicast Traffic Range: Multicast traffic ranges between 224.0.0.0 to 239.255.255.255 and is used in various applications.
Bursty Traffic: Multicast traffic can become bursty, disrupting the flow of traffic and causing output drops.
Traffic Management: Policing flattens bursts, while shaping smooths the output to manage traffic better.
Wireshark Analysis: Use Wireshark to analyze multicast traffic, create filters, and run I/O graphs to identify bursty traffic and output drops.
